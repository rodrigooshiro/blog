She was then in my kitchen and she started to clean them up with water jets.\n\n[2020-06-07]\nI was Cloud and had to look for Sephiroth. He had this power to lift buildings and throw them at us. I needed to find him somewhere, but I could not. Someone else was with me, but I don't know who and at some point we left to the frontyard and we flew up to the skies. There was a region down the ground where I used a power to summon a meteor and everything around that area was barren. And in the skies I found a cluster of bats that looked like a cloud of smoke and I used my powers to move those bats to the barren area to kill them all. But no Sephiroth was found from the skies. Back to the ground I was testing my powers and lifted a building with my mind, it was a hospital and I threw it at some mountain. Further into a forest I finally found him and he attacked me, but it wasn't the original Sephiroth, he was one of his offsprings. I was Cloud, but it seems I was ageless, time was not making me older, but Sephiroth was and he had to rely on his children to continue to exist and they were angry at me because I was just eternal, but not aware of this though.\n\n[2020-06-06]\nMy mother hired a guy to teach bow and arrow, but oddly he was using mine. Also the place was the frontyard of my house from years ago. At some point I was practicing by myself trying to shoot light switches in the garden.\n\n[2020-06-06]\nI moved to some sort of resort, there was a lot of people there. Near the entrance there was a path leading to an area to the left and it was sort of like a swimming area for beautiful people to gather. They were like showing off. I think a tall blond man was there and I knew him from somewhere else. My image in the mirror was different too, I was more handsome than I am in real life.\n\n[2020-06-05]\nI was going to the parking lot to pick it up my car to drive home and there was a line of cars also leaving the lot. I left easily, but on my way home I took a wrong turn and ended up in an unknown place and had to make some weird maneuvers to try to get back on track.\n\n[2020-06-05]\nI needed to write an algorithm, the only thing I knew was that there were two blocks and in the second I needed to debug more.\n\n[2020-06-04]\nI was in a supermarket shopping for groceries, also waiting to meet a woman that asked to meet me there. Then I went to a clothing store, I wanted to buy a jacket, there was one that was just like a black one I like to wear and is worn out. That one was from another brand and it was blue though, I was trying to find another black. Then someone from the store started to move the pieces around and I could not find the clothes anymore. I left my shoes in a store to make myself comfortable and kept looking for where I could find the clothes, but I was looking in the woman's section, so I kept looking and I thought I had finally found that blue jacket. Then I tried to find back my shoes, but the one that was in the place I left them was from an old lady. There were other shoes in there, none was mine, so I was really disappointed that someone could steal them at the mall.\n\n[2020-06-04]\nI was in a big tall building, there was a protest in one of the halls and it seems the room I was in could not have the people come in, but I was able to get out and in just fine. The problem was that the structure of the building was compromised, there was a big crack on the wall and the people from the hall wanted this addressed, but apperently it was too late as the building started to collapse. I ran as fast as I could, so others around me. The building was not imploding though, it was falling like a tree and as I ran, some corridors had doors at the rooms making the exit difficult as I had to open those doors.\n\n[2020-06-04]\nI was in a business party having dinner, then I noticed my mother was there. It appears my brother (I don't have a brother) brought her there, the place was kind like a resort. Once my mother noticed me she wanted to be around, but I told her I was still at work and that was not a regular dinner and that she should stay with my brother who brought her there.\n"},a3ea:function(e,t,a){var n={"./2020-06-dreams.md":"656e","./2020-06-projects.md":"a639"};function o(e){return Promise.resolve().then((function(){if(!a.o(n,e)){var t=new Error("Cannot find module '"+e+"'");throw t.code="MODULE_NOT_FOUND",t}var o=n[e];return a.t(o,7)}))}o.keys=function(){return Object.keys(n)},o.id="a3ea",e.exports=o},a639:function(e,t){e.exports="[2020-06-07]\nAnd as of today I have creted a new `#blog` project here on github. I am not in the mood to continue maintaining blogspot. Using github to edit markdowns are pretty easy, github pages can be published automatically on every commit, so I decided I will move everything to here eventually. I need to code, but that is the easy part though... Styling will be fun, but I am not in the mood right now, so I will leave the bootstrap default theme in play until I get inspired artistically again.\n\n[2020-06-07]\nSo I have been working a lot on my `#machine-learning` project here on github lately. I have finally completed adding the classical examples like regression, classification, dimentionality reduction and series prediction. I just happened to learn a lot about tensorflow, it was fun.\n\nWhile I was working on my last template about temperature forecasting I realized that to manipulate a lot of data in the browser just to send them back and forth to a backend is not very efficient and it is making the pipelines to run very, very slowly. There is also a problem with nodeJS, as when I tried to load all the 400k original entries directly from a script I created to train the network, there was that classic heap memory limitation that we get whenever we use too much memory. So even if I fix it in the browser, there will be problems in the backend as well.\n\nTo address the memory and performance when working with a lot of data, I realized I have to change the approach and start to create some sort of pipeline in the background, and start to use `tf.data.array` to avoid creating memory maps of the entire source and instead to have the array manipulated in chunks. But that can wait, it will be too much work for now.\n\nNow I need to document the template, add some sort of descriptions as well. For now I just split the training and the pre-trained models in different templates.\n\nAbout the performance, something interesting was the use of datasets, so instead of fitting X,Y training samples againts X,Y validation samples I now fit sets. But anyway, with my aged notebook from 9 years ago it will all be slow anyway....
