I was extreamily worried about my tooth, a strange dentist said I needed it repaired immediately and asked me to visit my previous dentist so she could fix them. She was then in my kitchen and she started to clean them up with water jets.

I was Cloud and had to look for Sephiroth. He had this power to lift buildings and throw them at us. I needed to find him somewhere, but I could not. Someone else was with me, but I don't know who and at some point we left to the frontyard and we flew up to the skies. There was a region down the ground where I used a power to summon a meteor and everything around that area was barren. And in the skies I found a cluster of bats that looked like a cloud of smoke and I used my powers to move those bats to the barren area to kill them all. But no Sephiroth was found from the skies. Back to the ground I was testing my powers and lifted a building with my mind, it was a hospital and I threw it at some mountain. Further into a forest I finally found him and he attacked me, but it wasn't the original Sephiroth, he was one of his offsprings. I was Cloud, but it seems I was ageless, time was not making me older, but Sephiroth was and he had to rely on his children to continue to exist and they were angry at me because I was just eternal, but not aware of this though.

My mother hired a guy to teach bow and arrow, but oddly he was using mine. Also the place was the frontyard of my house from years ago. At some point I was practicing by myself trying to shoot light switches in the garden.

I moved to some sort of resort, there was a lot of people there. Near the entrance there was a path leading to an area to the left and it was sort of like a swimming area for beautiful people to gather. They were like showing off. I think a tall blond man was there and I knew him from somewhere else. My image in the mirror was different too, I was more handsome than I am in real life.

I was going to the parking lot to pick it up my car to drive home and there was a line of cars also leaving the lot. I left easily, but on my way home I took a wrong turn and ended up in an unknown place and had to make some weird maneuvers to try to get back on track.

I needed to write an algorithm, the only thing I knew was that there were two blocks and in the second I needed to debug more.

I was in a supermarket shopping for groceries, also waiting to meet a woman that asked to meet me there. Then I went to a clothing store, I wanted to buy a jacket, there was one that was just like a black one I like to wear and is worn out. That one was from another brand and it was blue though, I was trying to find another black. Then someone from the store started to move the pieces around and I could not find the clothes anymore. I left my shoes in a store to make myself comfortable and kept looking for where I could find the clothes, but I was looking in the woman's section, so I kept looking and I thought I had finally found that blue jacket. Then I tried to find back my shoes, but the one that was in the place I left them was from an old lady. There were other shoes in there, none was mine, so I was really disappointed that someone could steal them at the mall.

I was in a big tall building, there was a protest in one of the halls and it seems the room I was in could not have the people come in, but I was able to get out and in just fine. The problem was that the structure of the building was compromised, there was a big crack on the wall and the people from the hall wanted this addressed, but apperently it was too late as the building started to collapse. I ran as fast as I could, so others around me. The building was not imploding though, it was falling like a tree and as I ran, some corridors had doors at the rooms making the exit difficult as I had to open those doors.

I was in a business party having dinner, then I noticed my mother was there. It appears my brother (I don't have a brother) brought her there, the place was kind like a resort. Once my mother noticed me she wanted to be around, but I told her I was still at work and that was not a regular dinner and that she should stay with my brother who brought her there.
